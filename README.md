# EL_3003 Intelligence Artificiel et Deep Learning 
> *EL 3019  Data Sciences is an academic course* :student:
 
>**Warning** : *This is an ongoing project*


### Unit description : 
The unit is an introdution to deep learning, with keras. We studied ConvNet and Dense neural netwoks. 
A focus is made on hyper-parameters, and regularisation techniques. The principal data proced are images from the MNIST dataset or some custom datasets.

#### Labs : 
The first six labs are training exercises, each focusing on a specific part of the deep learning process. 

### Project : 
The **[`final project`](https://github.com/Aubert-Antoine/EL_3003-IA_et_Deep_Learning/blob/main/Project%20FaceRecognition/)** is to do face rocognition on a small data base with a CNN, and then compare the efficency with other kind of classifier, such as KNN, SVM, and so on.
