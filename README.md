## Unit description : 
The unit is an introdution to deep learning, with keras. We studied ConvNet and Dense neural netwoks. 
A focus is made on hyper-parameters, and regularisation techniques. The principal data proced are images from the MNIST dataset or some custom datasets.

## Project : 
The **[`final project`](https://github.com/Aubert-Antoine/EL_3003-IA_et_Deep_Learning/blob/main/Project%20FaceRecognition/TP7_FaceRecognition.ipynb)** is to make face rocognition on a small data base with a CNN, and then compare the efficency with other kind of classifier, such as KNN, SVM, and so on.
